            <h4>Why work with a travel agent?</h4>
           <p>Working with a travel agent doesn’t only mean having someone contact hotels and make reservations for you – anyone can do that. Instead, I become the clients best advocate and plan their trip as if I were in their shoes. This covers everything from creating a personalized schedule of activities, ensuring they are expedited through customs upon arrival as well as sourcing the best tours, restaurants and cocktail bars.</p>

Plus, if you are flying, you better start thinking about booking your tickets sooner than later and we will gladly help with that.</p>
